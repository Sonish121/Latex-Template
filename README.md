This repository provides a LaTeX template designed to streamline the creation of user interface (UI) documentation. This template offers a structured framework for documenting UI components, facilitating consistency and efficiency in the documentation process.

## Features

- **Structured Layout**: Organizes UI elements into predefined sections, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all components.
- **Customization**: Allows easy modification to suit specific project requirements.
- **Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly with standard LaTeX editors and compilers.



1. **Compiling with PDFLaTeX**

Install LaTeX Distribution: Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
Open the Template: Open the main.tex file in your LaTeX editor (e.g., TeXstudio).
Compile the Document: Select appropriate compiler and compile the document to generate the PDF report.
Or you can directly compile through command line.

```bash
latexmk -pdf -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error -outdir=build main.tex

makeglossaries -d build main

latexmk -pdf -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error -outdir=build main.tex
```


## Customization
